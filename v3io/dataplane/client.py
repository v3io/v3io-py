        endpoint (Optional) : str
            The v3io endpoint to connect to (e.g. http://v3io-webapi:8081). if empty, the env var
            V3IO_API is used

            For future use
        transport_kind (Optional) : str/cls
            Defines the underlying transport to use towards v3io (one of httpclient, requests or a custom class). Should
            normally be left httpclient unless an underlying issue is found, in which case requests may

            If 'logger' is not provided, this will specify the verbosity of the created logger.
        transport_verbosity (Optional) : INFO / DEBUG
            If set to 'DEBUG', transport will log lots of information at the cost of performance. It uses
            the "debug_with" logger interface, so wither a logger set to DEBUG level must be passed in 'logger' or

            The path and collection (table) name of the item.
        access_key (Optional) : str
            The access key with which to authenticate. Defaults to the V3IO_ACCESS_KEY env.
        table_name (Optional) : str
            If passed, appended to the path to form the collection path
        attribute_names (Optional) : []str or '*'
            A list of attribute names to get, or '*' which will retreive all attributes
        filter_expression (Optional) : str
            A filter expression that restricts the items to retrieve. Only items that match the filter criteria
            are returned.
            See https://www.iguazio.com/docs/latest-release/data-layer/reference/expressions/condition-expression/#filter-expression.
        marker (Optional) : str
            An opaque identifier that was returned in the NextMarker element of a response to a previous GetItems
            request that did not return all the requested items. This marker identifies the location in the table
            from which to start searching for the remaining requested items. See Partial Response and the description
            of the NextMarker response element.
        sharding_key (Optional) : str
            The maximal sorting-key value of the items to get by using a range scan. The sorting-key value is the
            part to the right of the leftmost period in a compound primary-key value (item name). This parameter is
            applicable only together with the ShardingKey request parameter. The scan will return all items with the

            response object's Items array).
        segment (Optional) : str
            The ID of a specific table segment to scan - 0 to one less than TotalSegment
        total_segments (Optional) : str
            The number of segments into which to divide the table scan - 1 to 1024. See Parallel Scan.

        sort_key_range_start (Optional) : str
            The minimal sorting-key value of the items to get by using a range scan. The sorting-key value is the part
            to the right of the leftmost period in a compound primary-key value (item name). This parameter is
            applicable only together with the ShardingKey request parameter. The scan will return all items with

        container (Required) : str

        path (Required) : str
            The path of the stream.
        seek_type (Required) : str
            'EARLIEST': the location of the earliest ingested record in the shard.
            'LATEST': the location of the end of the shard.
            'TIME': the location of the earliest ingested record in the shard beginning at the base time set in the
                    TimestampSec and TimestampNSec request parameters. If no matching record is found (i.e., if all
                    records in the shard arrived before the specified base time) the operation returns the location
                    of the end of the shard.
            'SEQUENCE': the location of the record whose sequence number matches the sequence number specified in the
                        StartingSequenceNumber request parameter. If no match is found, the operation fails.
        access_key (Optional) : str
            The access key with which to authenticate. Defaults to the V3IO_ACCESS_KEY env.
        starting_sequence_number (Optional) : int
            Record sequence number for a sequence-number based seek operation - Type=SEQUENCE. When this parameter is
            set, the operation returns the location of the record whose sequence number matches the parameter.
        timestamp_sec (Optional) : int
            The base time for a time-based seek operation (Type=TIME), as a Unix timestamp in seconds. For example,
            1511260205 sets the search base time to 21 Nov 2017 at 10:30:05 AM UTC. The TimestampNSec request parameter
            sets the nanoseconds unit of the seek base time.

            When the TimestampSec and TimestampNSec parameters are set, the operation searches for the location of the
            earliest ingested record in the shard (the earliest record that arrived at the platform) beginning at the
            specified base time. If no matching record is found (i.e., if all records in the shard arrived before the
            specified base time), return the last location in the shard.
        timestamp_nsec (Optional) : int
            The nanoseconds unit of the TimestampSec base-time timestamp for a time-based seek operation (Type=TIME).
            For example, if TimestampSec is 1511260205 and TimestampNSec is 500000000, seek should search for the
            earliest ingested record since 21 Nov 2017 at 10:30 AM and 5.5 seconds.

        ----------
        container (Required) : str
            The container on which to operate.
        path (Required) : str
            The path of the stream.
        records (Required) : []dict
            A list of dictionaries with the following keys:
            - shard_id: int, optional
                        The ID of the shard to which to assign the record, as an integer between 0 and one less than
                        the stream's shard count. When both ShardId and PartitionKey are set, the record is assigned
                        according to the shard ID, and PartitionKey is ignored. When neither a Shard ID or a partition
                        key is provided in the request, the platform's default shard-assignment algorithm is used.
            - data: str, required
                    Record data.
            - client_info: bytes/bytearray, optional
                           Custom opaque information that can optionally be provided by the producer.
                           This metadata can be used, for example, to save the data format of a record, or the time at
                           which a sensor or application event was triggered.
            - partition_key: str, optional
                             A partition key with which to associate the record (see Record Metadata). Records with the
                             same partition key are assigned to the same shard, subject to the following exceptions: if
                             a shard ID is also provided for the record (see the Records ShardId request parameter),
                             the record is assigned according to the shard ID, and PartitionKey is ignored. In addition,
                             if you increase a stream's shard count after its creation (see UpdateStream), new records
                             with a previously used partition key will be assigned either to the same shard that was
                             previously used for this partition key or to a new shard. All records with the same
                             partition key that are added to the stream after the shard-count change will be assigned
                             to the same shard (be it the previously used shard or a new shard). When neither a Shard
                             ID or a partition key is provided in the request, the platform's default shard-assignment
                             algorithm is used

                [
                    {'shard_id': 1, 'data': 'first shard record #1'},
                    {'shard_id': 1, 'data': 'first shard record #2'},

            The access key with which to authenticate. Defaults to the V3IO_ACCESS_KEY env.
        limit (Optional) : int
            The maximum number of records to return in the response. The minimum is 1. There's no restriction on
            the amount of returned records, but the maximum supported overall size of all the returned records is
            10 MB and the maximum size of a single record is 2 MB, so calculate the limit accordingly.
