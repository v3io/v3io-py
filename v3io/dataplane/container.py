        Parameters
        ----------
        container (Required) : str
            The container on which to operate.
        path (Required) : str
            The path within the container
        access_key (Optional) : str
            The access key with which to authenticate. Defaults to the V3IO_ACCESS_KEY env.
        get_all_attributes (Optional) : bool
            False (default) - retrieves basic attributes
            True - retrieves all attributes of the underlying objects
        directories_only (Optional) : bool
            False (default) - retrieves objects (contents) and directories (common prefixes)
            True - retrieves only directories (common prefixes)
        limit (Optional) : int
            Number of objects/directories to receive. default: 1000
        marker (Optional) : str
            An opaque identifier that was returned in the NextMarker element of a response to a previous
            get_container_contents request that did not return all the requested items. This marker identifies the
            location in the path from which to start searching for the remaining requested items.

        Return Value
        ----------
        A `Response` object, whose `output` is `GetContainerContentsOutput`.
